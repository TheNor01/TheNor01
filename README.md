## :wave: About me
Hi, I’m @TheNor, but you can call me Aldo <br /> Currently I’m a Data Engineer at Blendee, but during my spare time i change my "hat" and i wear a Data Scientist one :robot:  <br />I achieved a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Catania. My Master's degree is still ongoing :muscle:
<br />

## :brain: What inspired me
Since the beginning of my studies, I have always had a passion for computer science. The curiosity of creating something out of nothing and bringing significant innovation to the world has always fascinated me. Helping people solve problems makes you a better person :heart:. Thus, this determination has transformed into passion.

## :computer: What i have done

Over the years, I have developed a growing interest in the realms of machine learning and big data. During my studies as a Data Scientist, I took on the role of Data Engineer at two different companies. In both positions, I designed data connectors for various platforms such as Facebook, Amazon (DSP, AMC), and Google Customer Match, primarily utilizing technologies like Scala and Spark.

Furthermore, I was involved in rewriting and optimizing batch processing modules to enhance execution times, managing and improving resource and data utilization within a Hadoop cluster. Additionally, I created dashboards on Grafana to display processed data loaded into ElasticSearch indices.

Meanwhile, my parallel academic background allowed me to delve deeper into the AI landscape through the development of personal projects (you can find them here on GitHub). In these projects, I predominantly utilized Python and Tensorflow for the development of neural networks and classification models in various contexts.

My next objective is to explore and study the new frontier of Large Language Models (LLM) in today's world and integrate them into applications and systems for common use.
